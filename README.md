# Network-Intrusion-Detection
End-to-end ML project for network intrusion detection using NSL-KDD dataset
## Description
This project implements an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for detecting malicious network traffic using the **modified NSL-KDD dataset**.  

The system classifies network connections as either **Normal** or **Attack**, and demonstrates:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Model training and comparison: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix
